I've been developing for web since 2008. I love writing clean code and I enjoy working with people. One of my strengths is to _translate_ wishes from the client to realistic specifications and goals for the development team. Technical projects can be challenging to tackle for those who aren't used to working with code. Helping the client understand developing software does not have to be scary and working towards a _human-centered_ final product is one of my favorite parts of the job.

My web career started as a front-end developer (HTML and CSS). Back in the day this was not as exciting as it is today so after a few years i switched to back-end development when I wanted to challenge myself and learn something new. At the moment, I work on a variety of projects and different stacks. I am happy to learn a new language or framework if it's necessary to get the job done right.
